# Dynamic-pricing-optimization-in-E-commerce-website
This project focuses on developing a dynamic pricing model for ecommerce products, aimed at optimizing pricing strategies to enhance profitability. We began by analyzing a dataset containing key variables such as visitor numbers, purchases, product categories, and historical pricing. Through exploratory data analysis and visualization, we identified significant patterns and correlations. Leveraging these insights, we implemented a dynamic pricing strategy that adjusts prices based on demand and supply multipliers derived from percentile calculations.
To predict the adjusted prices, we trained a RandomForestRegressor model. Initial results were promising, but we further refined the model using hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV, which significantly improved its performance. The final model demonstrated high accuracy with an RÂ² score of 0.94, alongside a Mean Absolute Error of 51.13 and a Mean Squared Error of 5744.00. This refined model not only provides accurate price predictions but also facilitates a more strategic approach to pricing, ultimately contributing to enhanced profitability and more effective decision-making in ecommerce.
